  == Hello from the Example

  You can embed characteristic symbols like #agility, #reason, #intuition, or #presence directly in the text. Comparators like #leq(10) or #geq(10) are also available, as are ranges like #range(1, 10).

  #lorem(100)
  
  === How are you?
  #roll-table(
    title: "Emotions",
    byline: "My emotions are unregulated, let's roll the dice.",
    columns: (1fr, 4fr),
    align: (center, left),
    breakable: false,
      [#leq(2)], [Happy],
      [#range(3, 5)], [Tired],
      [6], [Confused],
      [7], [Bored],
      [#geq(8)], [Happy],
  )

  It's totally cool to abuse the macros!
